Welcome to NJ4X, an implementation of the Java /.Net Forex API


Building NJ4X from the sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build an NJ4X binary distribution from an NJ4X source distribution,
you must have a J2SE(TM) version 1.7 or later installed
(see http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

Download and install Visual Studio Community (https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)

Unpack the NJ4X source distribution into a directory that will be
referred to as $NJ4X, and follow the instructions below.

* Download and install Apache Maven from
  http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
  The directory where Maven is installed will be referred to as
  $MAVEN_HOME (Add $MAVEN_HOME\bin to PATH environment variable).

* Open "mt4if\src\main\c++\mt45\mt45if.sln" once and upgrade it to the version of MS Visual Studio you got (project comes with v120_xp platform toolset (VS2013) for backward compatibility)

* Download nuget.exe (https://dist.nuget.org/index.html) and put its location to %PATH%

* Download launch4j (http://launch4j.sourceforge.net) and configure <launch4j.dir> property in root pom.xml

* Configure Microsoft Visual Studio paths in root pom.xml, e.g.

        <devenv>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe</devenv>
        <mstest>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\MSTest.exe</mstest>

* Configure 7Zip path in root pom.xml, e.g.

        <zip7>C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe</zip7>

* In $NJ4X\nj4x-src-2.6.2 directory you'd need to edit root pom.xml in order to set correct location for MS Visual Studio and 7Zip

* To build everything just issue the command "mvn clean package":

  $NJ4X\nj4x-src-2.6.2> mvn clean package

  Resulting artifacts can be found then in respective module's "target" directories, e.g.

    NJ4X Java library:  nj4x-src-2.6.2\jfx\target\jfx-2.6.2.jar 

                                (usage: java -jar nj4x-ts-2.6.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar)

    NJ4X .Net library:  nj4x-src-2.6.2\nj4x\target\nj4x.dll
